+ S : I'm the one who should deal with the field (A row should have only one S, may with multiple A, B, C and F.)
+ A : I can deal with it well.
+ B : I may can deal with it.
+ C : I may have the ability to solve a simple one.
+ F : Give up.

1. Combinatorics problems includes dp - combinatoric problems
2. Greedy includes math property.
